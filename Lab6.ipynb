You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",

Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. Convince me that your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. "
