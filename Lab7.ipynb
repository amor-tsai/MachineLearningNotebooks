In terms of generalization performance, it is helpful to have a large dataset of similar sized text documents. It is fine to perform binary classification or multi-class classification. The classification can be \"many-to-one\" or \"many-to-many\" sequence classification, whichever you feel more comfortable with. "

Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). Discuss methods of tokenization in your dataset as well as any decisions to force a specific length of sequence.  \n",
    "- [1 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",
    "- [1 points] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Shuffle splits? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. Convince me that your train/test splitting method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. "

Try to interpret if an analogy exists, show the vectors that support/refute the analogy, and interpret your findings. \n",
